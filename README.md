# Next.js 15 Client-Side Data Access Error

This repository demonstrates a potential runtime error in a Next.js 15 application when accessing client-side data (like localStorage) before the client-side JavaScript has fully loaded.  The error occurs because the code attempts to parse data from `window.localStorage` which might not be available during the initial render.

## Problem

The `pages/about.js` file attempts to read and parse data from `window.localStorage`. If the client-side JavaScript fails to load (e.g., due to network issues or JavaScript being disabled), this code will throw an error.

## Solution

The solution involves using a conditional check to handle cases where `window.localStorage` is undefined or unavailable and adding appropriate error handling to avoid crashes.
